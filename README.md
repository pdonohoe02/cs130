# cs130 project

This was my project for my CS 130: Software engineering class. 
The goal of the class was to build a backend for excel. 
The project was completeted in a group of 3, with two other students and
myself. I contributed roughly 70 percent of the code for this project. 

# Objectives

There were two main criterea that this project was tested on: accuracy
and performance. Therefore, throughout the development of this project,
we taylored our implementation to optimize for speed, in order to
pass performance benchmarks.
